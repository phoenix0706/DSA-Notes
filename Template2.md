# Frequency of Element in an Array

You are given an array of size “n” ; you are also given “Q” queries for each of the query please tell how many times a given number occurs in the array

---

## **Solution**:

### **Brute Force**:



#### Java

```java


```

Time Complexity: O(n\*q)

Space Complexity O(1)

---

### **Better Approach**


#### Java

```java



```

**_Output_**

```


```

Time Complexity: O(n+q)

Space Complexity O(m) where m is the largest number in array

---

### **Best Approach**

#### Java



```Java

```

#### Python

```python


```

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity O(n)
